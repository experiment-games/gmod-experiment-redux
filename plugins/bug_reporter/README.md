2. add the bot user that will report issues to that organization.

3. Go to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>

4. Fill in the form as follows:

    * Choose an expiration date that suits your needs.

    * Under `Resource Owner` select the organization you created in step 1.

    * Under `Repository Access` select `All repositories`.

    * Under `Permissions` click `Add permissions`, search `Issues` and select it.

    * Change the `Access` to `Read and write`.

    * Click `Generate token`, confirm and then copy the token.

5. Grant access from an owner account in the organization [here](https://github.com/organizations/experiment-games/settings/personal-access-token-requests)

6. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and paste your token in the `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` field.

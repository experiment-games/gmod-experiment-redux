## Content

**This project will maintain a minimal schema to run Experiment on Helix. It will only contain code and content that can be licensed under the MIT license.** This means we can not include content from the original Experiment schema that used third-party assets for items like the Exo Skeletons inside the repository.

Other third-party content may be included through the use of the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000). See [the `customizable_weaponry` plugin](plugins/customizable_weaponry) for an example of how to include third-party content.

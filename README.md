## Hosting a Server

For a quick overview check out the [üèó Dev Server Guide](docs/dev-server-guide.md). This guide will walk you through setting up a dedicated server for development purposes.

You can find more information on hosting a Garry's Mod server in the [official documentation](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Downloading_a_Dedicated_Server).

## Content

**This project will maintain a minimal schema to run Experiment on Helix. It will only contain code and content that can be licensed under the MIT license.** This means we can not include content from the original Experiment schema that used third-party assets for items like the Exo Skeletons inside the repository.

Other third-party content may be included through the use of the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000). See [the `customizable_weaponry` plugin](plugins/customizable_weaponry) for an example of how to include third-party content.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.

The original Experiment was developed by Conna Wiles around 2009. You'll find a lot of his code in this project, which you can originally find MIT licensed code in his [`kurozael/project-archive` repository](https://github.com/kurozael/project-archive)
